**Automated Backup System**

An automated backup management system built with **Bash scripting**.  
This tool helps you **automatically back up files, manage logs, and handle cleanup** tasks with simple commands and configuration.

**Features**

**Automated Backups** – Periodically backups your files or directories.  
**Cleanup Mode** – Removes old backups automatically.  
**Configurable Settings** – Uses a simple `backup.config` file for easy customization.  
**Detailed Logs** – Stores logs in `backup.log` for tracking all operations.  
**Lock File Mechanism** – Prevents concurrent backup runs.

**Project Structure**

├── backup.sh

**Configuration**
# backup.config
SOURCE_DIRS="./test_data"
BACKUP_DIR="./backups"
LOG_FILE="./backup.log"
RETENTION_DAYS=7

**Explanation**:

SOURCE_DIRS: Path(s) to directories or files you want to back up,
BACKUP_DIR: Directory where backups are stored,
LOG_FILE: Path to the backup log file,
RETENTION_DAYS: Number of days to keep old backups before deletion.

**How It Works**

The backup.sh script performs the following steps:
**Initialize Environment**:
Loads configuration from backup.config.
Creates necessary directories if they don’t exist.
Generates a timestamp for unique backup names.
**Perform Backup**:
Copies all files/directories listed in SOURCE_DIRS to BACKUP_DIR.
Compresses the backup into a .tar.gz archive.
Logs all actions in backup.log.
**Cleanup Mode**:
If executed with the --cleanup flag, removes backups older than RETENTION_DAYS.
**Lock Mechanism**:
Uses /tmp/backup.lock to ensure only one backup runs at a time.

**Usage**:
Run the script from the terminal:
# Run backup normally
bash backup.sh
# Run backup with cleanup mode
bash backup.sh --cleanup

**Example (Test Data Setup)**:
You can test the script using the sample test data provided in the repository:

mkdir -p test_data/documents test_data/media
echo "Hello, Backup System!" > test_data/documents/notes.txt
echo "Sample log data" > test_data/media/data.log

**Then verify the structure:**
ls -R test_data
**Log**:
All activities (successful backups, skipped files, cleanup events, etc.) are logged into backup.log.
You can view them using:
cat backup.log
